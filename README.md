EgoWeb 2.0 is an ongoing project by researchers at non-profit research organizations and Universities. EgoWeb 2.0 facilitates social network data collection and processing of personal networks, whole networks, and cognitive networks. EgoWeb has basic analysis procedures and can produce data output files for analysis in other programs.

EgoWeb 2.0 can be run on a webserver or installed on Windows and Mac machines. If run from a webserver, data can be collected by interviewers or by respondents themselves. Respondents can be sent links to unique surveys associated with their email addresses. Interviewers can also collect data in the field without a live internet connection with iPads and android tablets; the data are stored locally temporarily and then synced with a web server / removed from the tablet. EgoWeb 2.0 can also be installed on Windows and Mac machines and be used without any webserver connection at all.
